#  Identify relevant galaxy properties

Summary -- Set of large simulations and related mock catalogs for large scale structure investigations and covariances.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS9.1.1 ( 06/17 ): Document on "Lessons learned" from other surveys, such as BOSS and DES
* Key Task CS9.1.2 ( 06/17 ): Carry out simulations and generate mock catalogs
* Key Task CS9.1.3 ( 06/17 ): Investigate strategies for simplifying the simulations by, e.g., downgrading
resolution

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
